        <p>Extension Project
            Empowering Community ALS Implementers through Digital Citizenship
            </p>
        <div id="context">
                    <ul>This ICT training really broadened my horizons in understanding the Digital Citizenship subject. I don’t get a lot of chances to use or apply my previous learning in ICT, so this training was very helpful. I can recall and re-learn the basic skills and information that I acquired before. It’s really invigorating because I learned new things too.
                </ul>
 
                    <ul>The instructors were really good at discussing the topics, and they made sure that we clearly understood them. The topic of Creating a Simple Webpage was new to me. I was really curious before about how to do it, and I’m glad that Sir Walter Cariaga was able to teach us patiently how to do it step by step. It was really hard at first, but I’m happy because I was able to accomplish it. Moreover, the learning I gained from all the topics will be very helpful in my teaching career. I’m very grateful that I had the chance to be part of this training and meet these incredible instructors. 
                </ul>

                    <ul>My experiences with this extension project were very memorable. I got the chance to refresh previous knowledge, gain new insights, and expand my perspective on teaching, especially with the use of ICT. Furthermore, this training became easier with the help of the instructors. Also, it was really good to experience this with my co-Community ALS Implementers. Everyone was very eager to help one another, and it made the learning environment more fun and exciting.

                </ul>
                    <ul>Overall, this extension project was very productive, and I’m really thankful for the NBSC faculty and staff, especially to Ms. Cristine G. Sagaosao for spearheading this project in partnership with the Alternative Learning System. May this be the start of more projects and partnerships in the future.
                </ul>
